It was not possible to complete the planning with planner opt-blind for problem3 and problem4 because of limited amount of memory (16GB):

	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
	
It was possible to solve problem 3 with heuristic hmax and search method WA*.
Such a combination provided the same result for problem1, problem2 and the custom test problem of planner configuration opt-blind, but with less expanded nodes and evaluated states.
